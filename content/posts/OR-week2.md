Notes for Chapter 2: Overview of the Operations Research Modeling Approach

1. Define the problem and gather relavant data
1. Formulate a mathematical model
1. Deriving solutions
1. Test and refine the model
1. Prepare for the ongoing application of the model as prescribed by management
1. Implement

##### Define the problem and gather relavant data
- Define the Problem
    - OR teams normally work in an _advisory capacity_. It is vital for the OR team to be on the same wavelength as management, and be able to identify the "right" problem from the company's viewpoint.
    - OR concerned with welfare of the entire organization instead of a specific component.
    - Seek solutions that are optimal for the overall organization. 
    - Objs. should be as specific as possible all the while being consistant with the higher-level objs. of the org.

    - For profit making orgs...
        - long-run profit maximization
            - flexibility to consider activites that do not turn into profit immediately (research and development projects)
            - but need to do so eventually to be considered worthwhile
- Gather Data
    - Too much data available = bigger problem that too little
    - Tools such as data mining addresses these issues

##### Formulate a mathematical model to represent the problem
- helps reveal important cause-and effect relationships
    - indicates more clearly what additional data is needed
- need to be tactable (can be solved)
    - removable of unimportant details
    - absolute magnitude not as important as the values in relation to others
- required to have a high **correlation** between the prediction and the results in the real world
    - testing and modifying the model required for this
- begin with a simple version
##### Deriving solutions 
- Although it may seem like the major step, it usually is not.
- sometimes relatively simple, using a standard algorithm
- satisficing (satisfactory + optimizing)
    - a solution that is good enough
- optimizing vs satisficing
    - theory vs reality
    > "optimizing is the science of the ultimate; satisficing is the art of the feasible"
- postoptimality analysis (what-if analysis)
  - analysis done after finding an optimal solution
  - what would happen if different assumptions are made?

    
##### Test the model and refine it as needed
##### Prepare for the ongoing application of the model as prescribed by management
##### Implement
