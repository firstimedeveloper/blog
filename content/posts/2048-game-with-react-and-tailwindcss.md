You can check out the game from the following [link](https://2048.junhyukhan.com).
And the github page [here](https://github.com/firstimedeveloper/2048).


I've been learning to use react and tailwindcss during my free time and decided to recreate the classic [2048](https://play2048.co/) game by Gabriele Cirulli (Which I'm assuming you're already aware, if somehow you landed on *this* post 😅).

I have to admit the code itself is pretty bad and the game itself is completely unorginal. However, that doesn't mean the process of making this game didn't teach me a few things. 

I've seen *a lot* of posts and videos telling people to just start coding even though it'll be really bad. In fact, one quote I really like is
> Writing bad code is a prerequisite to writing good code.  
> -- *someone from the internet*

And prior to this, I would focus (too much) on finding tutorials or guides or blog posts of other people doing something. And although there are some quality tutorials and posts out there, and it seems to make the learning process **much** easier, it just doesn't compare to you actually spending the time to figure it out on your own.
