You can check out the game from the following [link](https://2048.junhyukhan.com).
And the github page [here](https://github.com/firstimedeveloper/2048)


I've been learning to use react and tailwindcss during my free time and decided to recreate the classic [2048](https://play2048.co/) game by Gabriele Cirulli (Which I'm assuming you're already aware, if somehow you landed on *this* post ðŸ˜…).

I have to admit the code itself is pretty bad and the game itself is completely unorginal. However, that doesn't mean the process of making this game didn't teach me a few things.
