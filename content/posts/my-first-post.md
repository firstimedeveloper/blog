This is my first post made with hugo and deployed using netlify.

I am a university student in (South) Korea studying Industrial Engineering, who spends his free time on learning to develop software. ðŸ˜… 


I am hoping this blog will help myself as well as tens of other 'firstimedevelopers' around the world in becoming better versions of ourselves (...or something else that doesn't sound too generic).  
It's really just to see for myself how much writing what you have learned helps with retention.

Some topics I can see myself writing about are (in no specific order): 
- go(lang)
- react.js
- open source
- tailwindcss
- wsl (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
- perhaps some university courses
- or even my endeavours on learning a new language, which is currently german

Anyways lets begin!
