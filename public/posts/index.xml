      <description>This is my first post made with hugo and deployed using netlify.
I am a university student in (South) Korea studying Industrial Engineering, who spends his free time on learning to develop software. ðŸ˜…
I am hoping this blog will help myself as well as tens of other &amp;lsquo;firstimedevelopers&amp;rsquo; around the world in becoming better versions of ourselves (&amp;hellip;or something else that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound too generic).
It&amp;rsquo;s really just to see for myself how much writing what you have learned helps with retention.</description>
