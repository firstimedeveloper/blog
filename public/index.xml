      <description>This is my first post made with hugo and deployed using netlify.
I am a university student in (South) Korea studying Industrial Engineering, who spends his free time on learning to develop software. ðŸ˜…
I am hoping this blog will help myself as well as tens of other &amp;lsquo;firstimedevelopers&amp;rsquo; around the world in becoming better versions of ourselves (&amp;hellip;or something else that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound too generic).
It&amp;rsquo;s really just to see for myself how much writing what you have learned helps with retention.</description>

      <description>This article is written as a reminder for myself so that I donâ€™t spend hours setting things up in the future again, and for any others who have no idea how to start a heroku project from an existing webapp written in golang. Remember that I am in no way an expert, and you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t trust blindly whatâ€™s written here. These steps worked for me, but thereâ€™s no guarantee that itâ€™ll work for you.</description>
